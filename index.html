                            <li>Utilized a decision tree and logistic regression models. The bookings' number of adults, number of children, number of weekend nights, number of weeknights, type of meal plan, required parking space, room type, lead time, arrival month, arrival date, market segment, repeated guest, number of previous cancellations, number of previous bookings not cancelled, average price per room, number of special requests and booking status were all analyzed.</li>
                            <li>The pre-pruned decision tree gave a generalized performance with balanced values of precision and recall, an f1-score of 0.809, and could correctly identify 85.7 percent of booking statuses, potentially saving the hotel thousands of dollars per year.</li>
                            <li>Observed that if the lead time is less than or equal to 151 days, then the booking is least likely to be canceled.</li>
